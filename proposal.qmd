# Data 1

## Introduction and data

-   Identify the source of the data.

-   State when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data).

-   Write a brief description of the observations.

The dataset includes weather data for states and cities, based on specific dates and times of observations. The dataset also provides information on predicted versus observed temperature, as well as predicted versus observed percipitation. 
## Research question

-   A well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)

-   The data gives the temperature that is predicted at 12, 24 and 36 hours before the temperature was observed and then the actual temeprature observed. We will look at how the difference in predicted vs observed temperature changes depending on the amount of time between the forecast and the observed temperature. We will then look at how this difference fluctuates by the state the the forecasts and obseravtions are made in. 

-   A description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.

-   Identify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?

Our research question contains three quantitative variables (predicted and actual forecast, hours before observation), and one categorical variable (state). 

## Literature

-   Find one published credible article on the topic you are interested in researching.

-   Provide a one paragraph summary about the article.

-   In 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.

# Data 2

## Introduction and data

-   Identify the source of the data.
The data comes from the National UFO Reporting Center and consists of 80,332 reported sightings of UFOs.

-   Write a brief description of the observations.

## Research question

-   A well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)

How does the location of the UFO sighting affect both how the UFO is described by the reporter and the date of the sighting?

-   Identify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?

<<<<<<< HEAD
There are both categorical and quantitative variables in the dataset. The categorical variables include the location (city, state, and country) of the UFO sighting, as well as a description of the UFO. Some of the quantitative variables include the encounter length with the UFO and the latitude and longitude of the sighting.
